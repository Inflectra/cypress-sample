# Cypress Reporter for Spira
This is a sample cypress project that uploads Cypress test results automatically to Inflectra's SpiraTest, SpiraTeam or SpiraPlan (hereafter just Spira).

It is implemented as a custom reporter that you can easily add to your existing Cypress projects and have the benefit of the test results and screenshots automatically upload against the corresponding Spira test case.
